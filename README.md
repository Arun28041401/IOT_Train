**IDEA TITLE :** TRAIN COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM

**PROBLEM STATEMENT TITLE :** DEVELOP AN ADVANCED TCAS THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY PREVENT COLLISIONS AND ENSURE THE SAFE OPERATION OF TRAINS IN VARIOUS RAILWAY ENVIRONMENTS

**IDEA:**

 • This TCAS (Train Collision Avoidance System) is used to detect 
trains activity and prevent collision between trains or objects

 • RFID(Radio Frequency id) tags are placed in trains and RFID 
reader placed in railway tracks with unique id number 
respectively to track the activity of trains.

 • If both train enters the same track in opposite  or one after other 
manner, this is found using the RFID technology. This scenario 
can be prevented  by activating the emergency  break.

 • LiDARand laser sensors  are being used in additional purpose 
for monitoring and measuring the obstacles on the track.

 • Cameras can also be used for surveillance on inside and outside 
of  train.

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
1. LiDARSensor 
2. Laser Sensor
3. RF-id Tag
4. ArduinoUno & IDE
